Cloudkuimages provides a secure, high-performance file upload service with support for files up to 10GB.\nThe system uses automatic chunked uploads, content moderation via Sightengine, and delivers direct file URLs upon success. All uploads are scanned for adult content, weapons, drugs, and offensive material. Unsafe files are automatically rejected. POST https://cloudkuimages.guru/ Supports both single-file and chunked uploads via the same endpoint. 1. Single File Upload (for files ≤ 100MB) Send the file directly in a POST request with multipart/form-data. 2. Chunked Upload (for files up to 10GB) Split your file into chunks (recommended: 8MB each) and send them sequentially. Include chunk: current chunk index (0-based) Include chunks: total number of chunks Include filename: original file name Include fileId: unique session ID (e.g. UUID or timestamp-based) Include size: total file size in bytes After all chunks are sent, finalize the upload: All responses are in application/json. Security & Moderation All uploaded images (≤5MB) are scanned by Sightengine Blocked file types: .php, .phtml, .htaccess, etc. Unsafe content (nudity, gore, weapons, etc.) is automatically deleted Maximum file size: 10 GB Maximum chunk size: no hard limit (but 8MB recommended) File retention: permanent (until manual deletion)",
